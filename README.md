BlockSiteGoogle
===============

BlockSiteGoogle is an import file for SiteBlock that will block every Google-owned domain.

Use it to find out how much Google you have in your online life, or to get Google out of it.

You need Firefox and the BlockSite extension for this to have any use.

Get the [Block Site Addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blocksite/).
